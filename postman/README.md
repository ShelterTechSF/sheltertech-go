#### API Documentation

There is a new collection `Sheltertech_Data.postman_collection.json` that serves as a functional API doc for a read of set only endpoints.
This uses the `Development`, `Staging`, or `Production` environments.  

We can expand on this documentation to include the Change Request and Admin interfaces.

This new collection syncs with Postman's cloud hosting and reflects at `sfserviceguide.org SLASH api-docs`
